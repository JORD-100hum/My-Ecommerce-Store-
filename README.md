### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Set Up the Project Directory**:
   - Download the project files to a folder on your system.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the project:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/project
     ```

   - Create a new database for the project:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;
     ```
   - Import the `database.sql` file into your database to create the required tables and seed data:
     - For command-line users:
       ```bash
       mysql -u your-username -p ecommerce < database.sql
       ```
     - For GUI tools, use the "Import" feature and select the `database.sql` file.


5. **Run the Server**:
